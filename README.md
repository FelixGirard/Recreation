# Recreation
VR experimentation to simulate an optic experiment.
The idea was that it would be nicer for student to have some experiments in VR, because we can overlay information in real time.

# Features
## Source light reflecting on objects
On the table, you can see a source emiting a ray that bounces on the objects. This should emulate the path of a light in the real world.
You can move the objects around and see the resulting reflections.

## Whiteboard
A whiteboard to do some calculation. The drawing is done via a shader to not impact performance, and allow bigger resolution.
